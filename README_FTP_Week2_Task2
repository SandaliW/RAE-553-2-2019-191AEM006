#        As the second task I need to  figure out how to upload my own files to some FTP server. 

#        There are two methods for uploading files:
#            1)storlines :- upload text files to the FTP server and calles the readline() method 
                            on each line in the file until it reads the last line
                            
             2)storbinary :- upload binary files to the FTP server and calles the read() method 
                             until there is no more data to read and upload

#         Almost all the time FTP serevers denied anonymous logins. Here we use a mirror FTP server and logged in successfully,
#         but as we can see when we try to upload a file form  local directory to the remote directory on the mirror server 
#         the permission will be denied
           
>>> from ftplib import FTP
>>> ftp = FTP('ftp.lt.debian.org')
>>> ftp.login();
'230 Login successful.'

#         So because of that if we want upload any files to a FTP server we need to gain username qand password to login.
#         Or we can make our own FTP server. In order to that in Debian GNU/Linux terminal

useradd@DESKTOP-RLT3H68:~$ sudo yum install vsftpd

#       to enable the server configuration 
useradd@DESKTOP-RLT3H68:~$ sudo nano /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf  

#       Then we need to disable access of annonymous login and enable uselogin for local authentication files
useradd@DESKTOP-RLT3H68:~$ anonymous_enable=NO
useradd@DESKTOP-RLT3H68:~$ local_enable=YES

#       To make changes to the filesystem
useradd@DESKTOP-RLT3H68:~$ write_enable=YES

#       To restrict users to have access only to their home directories
useradd@DESKTOP-RLT3H68:~$ chroot_local_user=YES

#       After making these changes, save the file and quit. Then, restart 
useradd@DESKTOP-RLT3H68:~$ sudo service vsftpd restart

#       Then open a terminal window(Miniconda3)  and enter
ftp localhost

#       After thatI tried the previous code but it didn't work
