#                First of all we have to choose a FTP server as our source.
#               Most of the Linux distributives have FTP mirrors with free access. 
#               For present work we will use one of the mirrors on Debian's web-site: https://www.debian.org/mirror/list
#               I choose Lithuanian FTP server since it is the nearest.
#               To ensur the safety it is better to crate our own environment. So creatin a new environment will be our first step.

(base) C:\Users\User>conda create -n 191AEM006_FTP.env               # Created an environment of my own

#               Second step will be to avtivate that created environment. Since I used Miniconda3, command will be

(base) C:\Users\User>conda activate 191AEM006_FTP.env

#               Then I listed all the tools or packages in my environment

(191AEM006_FTP.env) C:\Users\User>conda list


#                Since  need to use python, I installed it to my environment

(191AEM006_FTP.env) C:\Users\User>conda install python

#                To connect to FTP server using python we need to import necessary library

>>> from ftplib import FTP

#                Then we can define the FTP mirror we want connect

>>> ftp = FTP('ftp.lt.debian.org')

#                Then we can log in to it by using the command and if we are connected to the FTP server we will get a notification

>>> ftp.login();
'230 Login successful.'

#               We can explore available directories using these two methods                
#1)
>>> data = ftp.retrlines('LIST')

#2)           second method to explore directories

'226 Directory send OK.'
>>> print(data)
226 Directory send OK.
#           As we can see those twpo methods give the same results
#           After thatb we are changing the directory and to debian. if successful we will get notified

>>> ftp.cwd('debian')
'250 Directory successfully changed.'

#            we set the path to where our file will be downloaded
            
>>> out = 'C/User/Users/Downloads/README.html'

#           Then we can download a file using the following commands in terminal and if suuccessful we will get notified.

>>> with open('out', 'wb') as f:
...     ftp.retrbinary('RETR ' + 'README.html', f.write)
...
'226 Transfer complete.

#           Then our README file will be downloaded as a .html file.
#           As the next task we need to convert it into .txt file without html tags. For that we can use two methods
#                1) SED       2)AWK
#
